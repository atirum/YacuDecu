The source code of the XTension is located in the src/ directory, and the 
latest version can be found on github: https://github.com/bobpepin/YacuDecu/.

To compile the XTension, first compile the YacuDecu library as described 
in the src/README.md file. Then, after installing the pre-requisites 
listed at the top of compileXT.m, run compileXT.m in a Matlab session to 
generate the ImarisXT .exe file.
